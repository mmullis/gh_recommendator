First attempt was going to load data into CouchDB. Far too slow for me.

Second attempt is to make sure everything is working. 
The results.txt file in this version is created by a a random selection of 10 repos from the list of repos.
Mostly curious to see how well random recommendations will do.
My code is in Erlang but I'm too embarrassed by my code to post it yet.
